# mkt
Python module to compute the Mann-Kendall test for trend in time series data.

This module contains a single function 'test' which implements the Mann-Kendall
test for a linear trend in a given time series. 


# Installation

1. Simply clone this repository and copy ``mkt.py`` in the directory where you are
working in.

2. Alternatively, you can clone this repository to a desired directory of your
choice and then create and Python startup file ``.pythonstartup`` in your 
home directory as:
```python
import sys
import os
home = os.path.expanduser("~")
sys.path.append(home + "/<path_to_package>")
```
Save the file, and that's it! From then on, all python shells should be able to
detect (and import) the ``bpl`` package without any problem.
